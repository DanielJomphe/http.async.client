#+TITLE: Async Http Client - Clojure
#+AUTHOR: Hubert Iwaniuk

* Intro
  *ahc-clj* is Async Http Client for Clojure.

  Will not block a thread to wait for response.

  Will return a [[http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/promise][clojure.core/promise]] that will be
  [[http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/deliver][clojure.code/deliver]]ed once response is completed.

  Allows you to provide callbacks that will get triggered on Http
  Response events like:
  - received status line,
  - received headers,
  - received body part,
  - completed request,
  - handle error.

  That should allow to consume streams.
* Sample

  (println (:server headers))
  (println (apply str (map char body))))
